## KeyLime

KeyLime is a simple yet tangy WordPress starter theme, based on the wonderful _s or underscores theme by Automattic.

### Notes
A custom build of [modernizr](http://modernizr.com/download/#-fontface-flexbox-flexboxlegacy-multiplebgs-rgba-csscolumns-generatedcontent-cssgradients-inlinesvg-svg-svgclippaths-shiv-cssclasses-teststyles-testprop-testallprops-prefixes-domprefixes-css_backgroundposition_xy-css_backgroundsizecover-css_boxsizing-css_calc-css_vhunit-css_vmaxunit-css_vminunit-css_vwunit-load) is included. The URL above will show you which features this build is set up to detect, and allow you to generate your own custom build.

**I highly recommend generating your own build, containing *only* the items you need to detect.** As you might expect, the more features you detect, the bigger the file size of your modernizr build. But another consideration is that each feature that is detected requires running some sort of test before the page loads. If you're at all concerned with performance (and honestly if you're not concerned about performance, you should be doing something other than building websites), you want to load as few tests as possible.
